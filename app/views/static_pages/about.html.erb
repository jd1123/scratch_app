	<h1>About This site</h1>
</div>
<p>
	My name is Johnnydiabetic. This is my site made with <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org" %>.
	I like technology and programming, and I am trying to learn Ruby.
	I like Python better, but hey, I like to try new things.<br> 
	I am married to a wonderful woman named Jules. She can be annoying at times,
	but mostly she is good. She loves pizza and meatloaf.
