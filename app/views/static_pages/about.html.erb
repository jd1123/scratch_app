	<h1>About This site</h1>
	<p>
		This is my site made with <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org" %>. <br>
		My name is Johnnydiabetic. I like technology and programming, and I am trying to learn Ruby.
		I like Python better, but hey, I like to try new things.<br> 
		I am married to a wonderful woman named Jules. She can be annoying at times,
		but mostly she is good. She loves pizza and meatloaf.
